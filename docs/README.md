# Product Recommentation System

## Introduction
### Dataset
The [Black Friday dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mehdidag/black-friday) contains 550,000 observations about Black Friday sales in a particular retail store. The dataset provides some information about the customer and the item being purchased. 

Each entry in the dataset is an instance of a customer making a purchase of a particular item during a particular transaction (a particular time), regardless of quantity. Thus, a customer purchasing different items in the same transaction exists as different entries, a customer purchasing the same item across different transactions (different times) exists as different entries, and a customer purchasing multiple of the same item in the same transaction exists as a single entry.
